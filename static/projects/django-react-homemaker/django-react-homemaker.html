    This app utilizes an API for the backend written using Django, which interfaces with the React frontend.

    It supports maintenance of a pantry of ingredients, collecting recipes and logging/planning meals.

    The size and scope of this app is the largest I had attempted at that point, and it required very thorough planning to execute. I had all the models and API endpoints 
    mapped out before I even started coding, which helped me tons in regards to the speed of developing this giant project.

    I also learned a lot about versioning my codebase using git and maintaining 
    issues on Github to keep track of the needed changes.

    This project is definitely the most polished one I've done until this point (it has error highlighting for forms, convenient UI, did not cut any corners in regards to my design vision).
    I'm very proud of how it turned out.
