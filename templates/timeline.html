                            Returned to Gudo Investment Advisory as Software Developer Intern.
                            This time, I was fortunate to be given the opportunity to work closely with the other engineers on a large
                            system migration project. 
                            This internship taught me a lot about what it's like to be a software engineer. From requirement engineering, regular meetings
                            with product managers, frequent code reviews and the occasional overtime, I grew a lot as a software developer!

                            I was working with various technologies to aid in my responsibilities, which include data science as well as web development.

                            This course introduces some of the fundamental design methods used in programming which can be utilized to break down very complex programs into 
                            manageable pieces. They teach function design, data design and also provide a robust method to use recursion (which I've always struggled with). 
                            Although this course is targeted at beginners, self taught programmers like myself have much to gain from this seemingly basic course.</span>
